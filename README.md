The smart contract from the GitHub link may not "fail" in the sense of being non-functional, but it does exhibit severa potential vulnerabilities and areas for improvement. 

Errors

- The contract does not provide a way to change the owner if needed.

- In the withdrawTips function, there is a potential reentrancy attack vector.

- Emitting events before executing state changes is not recommended due to the possibility of state changes failing, leading to inconsistent state with respect to events.

- The contract should have a receive or fallback function to handle plain Ether transfers.

Modifications

- Implement a function to allow the owner to transfer ownership.

- Use a pattern like the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern or a reentrancy guard.

- Emit events after state changes to ensure they reflect the actual state.

- Implement a receive function to handle direct Ether transfers.
